## Description

This tool is made to make it convenient to transfer Visual Studio Code extensions from an online computer to an offline computer. It basically just downloads all your installed extensions from the online computer and puts them in a folder or archive. The files are vsix which is easy to install using Visual Studio Code (Go to Extensions -> Install from VSIX...).

As an option you can select to download the extensions into a folder structure like

* Publisher
  * Extension
    * Version

This is handy when using on-premise repository tools like Artifacory.
